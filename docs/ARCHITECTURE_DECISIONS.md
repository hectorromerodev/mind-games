## ADR-001: Frontend Framework Selection

### Status
**Accepted** - 2025-07-04

### Context
We need to select a frontend framework for building the Mind Games platform. The platform requires:
- Fast loading times
- SEO-friendly pages
- Interactive game components
- Easy deployment
- Good developer experience

### Decision
We will use **Astro 5** as our frontend framework.

### Rationale
**Pros:**
- **Islands Architecture**: Allows for selective hydration of interactive components
- **Performance**: Ships minimal JavaScript by default
- **SEO**: Excellent static site generation capabilities
- **Flexibility**: Can integrate with any UI framework if needed
- **Modern**: Built-in TypeScript support
- **Developer Experience**: Great tooling and documentation

**Cons:**
- **Learning Curve**: Relatively new framework
- **Ecosystem**: Smaller community compared to React/Vue
- **Complex Interactions**: May need additional libraries for complex state management

### Alternatives Considered
- **Next.js**: More complex for our use case, over-engineered
- **Vue.js**: Good option but requires more setup for SSG
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Too low-level for rapid development

### Consequences
- Fast, SEO-friendly pages
- Need to learn Astro-specific patterns
- Excellent performance out of the box
- Easy deployment to various platforms

## ADR-002: Styling Framework Choice

### Status
**Accepted** - 2025-07-04

### Context
We need a styling solution that provides:
- Rapid UI development
- Consistent design system
- Responsive design capabilities
- Good performance
- Easy customization

### Decision
We will use **Tailwind CSS v4** with the **@tailwindcss/vite** plugin.

### Rationale
**Pros:**
- **Utility-First**: Rapid development with utility classes
- **Performance**: Automatic purging of unused CSS
- **Consistency**: Design system through configuration
- **Responsive**: Built-in responsive design utilities
- **Customization**: Easy to extend and customize
- **v4 Benefits**: Improved performance and developer experience

**Cons:**
- **Learning Curve**: Requires learning utility class names
- **HTML Verbosity**: Classes can become lengthy
- **Design Constraints**: May limit creative freedom

### Alternatives Considered
- **CSS Modules**: Good isolation but more verbose
- **Styled Components**: Runtime overhead
- **Bootstrap**: Less flexible, larger bundle size

### Consequences
- Rapid UI development
- Consistent design system
- Excellent performance
- Need to learn Tailwind conventions

## ADR-003: Game Architecture Pattern

### Status
**Accepted** - 2025-07-04

### Context
We need an architecture pattern for game development that:
- Promotes code reuse across games
- Maintains consistency in game behavior
- Allows for easy addition of new games
- Provides common functionality (scoring, timing, etc.)

### Decision
We will use the **Abstract Base Class Pattern** with a `BaseGameClass` that all games extend.

### Rationale
**Pros:**
- **Code Reuse**: Common functionality in base class
- **Consistency**: All games follow same patterns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new games
- **Maintainability**: Changes to common functionality in one place
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces ensure contract compliance

**Cons:**
- **Inheritance Complexity**: Can lead to complex inheritance hierarchies
- **Tight Coupling**: Games coupled to base class implementation

### Alternatives Considered
- **Composition Pattern**: More flexible but more complex setup
- **Module Pattern**: Good for simple games but lacks structure
- **Plugin Architecture**: Over-engineered for current needs

### Consequences
- Consistent game behavior
- Easy addition of new games
- Shared functionality across games
- Need to carefully design base class interface

## ADR-004: State Management Strategy

### Status
**Accepted** - 2025-07-04

### Context
We need a state management strategy that:
- Handles game state during gameplay
- Manages user preferences
- Provides good performance
- Keeps complexity low

### Decision
We will use **Local Component State** with **Browser LocalStorage** for persistence.

### Rationale
**Pros:**
- **Simplicity**: No external dependencies
- **Performance**: Direct state access
- **Persistence**: LocalStorage for user data
- **Scope**: State scoped to where it's needed

**Cons:**
- **Sharing**: Difficult to share state between components
- **Complexity**: Manual state synchronization
- **Storage Limits**: LocalStorage size limitations

### Alternatives Considered
- **Redux/Zustand**: Over-engineered for current needs
- **Context API**: Would require React-like framework
- **Global Objects**: Poor maintainability

### Consequences
- Simple state management
- Good performance
- May need refactoring for complex features
- Limited cross-component state sharing

## ADR-005: Build Tool Selection

### Status
**Accepted** - 2025-07-04

### Context
We need build tools that provide:
- Fast development server
- Efficient bundling
- Good integration with Astro
- Support for modern JavaScript features

### Decision
We will use **Vite** as our build tool (comes with Astro).

### Rationale
**Pros:**
- **Speed**: Fast development server with HMR
- **Modern**: Native ES modules support
- **Integration**: Excellent Astro integration
- **Plugins**: Rich ecosystem of plugins
- **Performance**: Efficient production builds

**Cons:**
- **Browser Support**: Requires modern browsers for dev
- **Configuration**: Can be complex for advanced use cases

### Alternatives Considered
- **Webpack**: Slower development server
- **Rollup**: Good for libraries, less ideal for apps
- **Parcel**: Good but less ecosystem support

### Consequences
- Fast development experience
- Efficient production builds
- Good tooling ecosystem
- Modern JavaScript features support
