# Mind Games - Universal Scoring System

## Overview

The Mind Games platform features a standardized scoring system that provides consistent, fair, and meaningful performance evaluation across all games. This system is designed to be transparent, adaptable, and scientifically informed, allowing players to compare their performance across different cognitive challenges.

## Core Scoring Principles

### 1. **Consistency Across Games**
All games use the same fundamental scoring framework, ensuring fair comparison and unified progress tracking.

### 2. **Multi-Dimensional Assessment**
Performance is evaluated across multiple cognitive dimensions:
- **Accuracy**: Precision and attention to detail
- **Speed**: Reaction time and processing efficiency  
- **Progression**: Learning rate and adaptation
- **Consistency**: Performance stability and error management

### 3. **Adaptive Difficulty**
Scoring scales appropriately with game difficulty and player progression.

## Universal Scoring Components

### Base Score Calculation

Every game round uses this fundamental formula:

```
Round Score = (Correct Answers × Base Points + Round Bonus + Streak Bonus) 
              × Difficulty Multiplier × Time Bonus - Accuracy Penalty
```

#### Component Breakdown

**Base Points**
- Foundation score for each correct action
- Varies by game type (50-200 points)
- Ensures meaningful baseline scoring

**Round Bonus** 
- Progressive bonus: `Round Number × Round Bonus Value`
- Rewards sustained performance and advancement
- Encourages longer play sessions

**Streak Bonus**
- Applied every 3 consecutive correct actions
- Formula: `floor(streak / 3) × Streak Bonus Value`
- Rewards consistency and flow states

**Time Bonus** (when applicable)
- Multiplier: `max(0.5, 2 - (time_seconds × 0.1))`
- Rewards quick thinking and efficient processing
- Caps at 2x for exceptional speed, minimum 0.5x

**Accuracy Penalty**
- Direct deduction: `Mistakes × Accuracy Weight`
- Emphasizes precision over speed
- Prevents random clicking strategies

**Difficulty Multiplier**
- Global game difficulty scaling (1.0-2.5x)
- Ensures harder games provide proportional rewards
- Maintains balance across game types

## Performance Level System

### Universal Performance Classification

Performance is evaluated using a composite score that normalizes across all games:

```
Performance Score = (Avg Score/Round × 0.4) + (Accuracy × 1000 × 0.3) + 
                   (Efficiency × 0.2) + (Total Rounds × 10 × 0.1)
```

| Score Range | Level | Color | Description | Population % |
|-------------|-------|-------|-------------|--------------|
| 800+ | Outstanding Master | Purple | Exceptional mastery and skill | ~2% |
| 600-799 | Excellent Expert | Blue | High-level expertise and consistency | ~8% |
| 450-599 | Great Performer | Green | Above-average performance | ~15% |
| 300-449 | Good Player | Cyan | Solid competence | ~25% |
| 150-299 | Solid Beginner | Gray | Developing skills | ~30% |
| 50-149 | Learning Player | Orange | Early learning phase | ~15% |
| <50 | Practice More | Red | Needs more practice | ~5% |

### Performance Metrics

**Accuracy Rate**
- `(Total Correct / Total Attempts) × 100%`
- Primary indicator of precision and focus

**Average Response Time**
- Mean time per action across all rounds
- Measures processing speed and decision-making

**Efficiency Score**
- `Total Score / (Total Time in seconds)`
- Balances speed and accuracy for optimal performance

**Progression Rate**
- Improvement in performance over time
- Indicates learning curve and adaptation

## Game-Specific Configurations

### Memory Games (Simon Says, Memory Matrix)
```typescript
{
  basePoints: 100,
  timeBonus: true,
  accuracyWeight: 50,
  difficultyMultiplier: 1.5,
  roundBonus: 25,
  streakBonus: 50
}
```
- Emphasizes working memory and sequence retention
- Moderate time pressure with accuracy focus
- Progressive difficulty scaling

### Reaction Games (Speed Tests, Reflex Challenges)
```typescript
{
  basePoints: 50,
  timeBonus: true,
  accuracyWeight: 100,
  difficultyMultiplier: 2.0,
  roundBonus: 10,
  streakBonus: 25
}
```
- Prioritizes speed and quick decision-making
- High accuracy penalty to prevent spam clicking
- Significant time bonus rewards

### Puzzle Games (Logic Puzzles, Pattern Recognition)
```typescript
{
  basePoints: 200,
  timeBonus: false,
  accuracyWeight: 150,
  difficultyMultiplier: 1.2,
  roundBonus: 50,
  streakBonus: 100
}
```
- Rewards deep thinking and problem-solving
- No time pressure to encourage thoughtful approaches
- High streak bonuses for sustained problem-solving

## Implementation Guidelines

### For New Games

1. **Choose Configuration**: Select appropriate predefined config or create custom
2. **Define Actions**: Determine what constitutes a "correct answer"
3. **Set Timing**: Establish round duration and time bonus applicability
4. **Calibrate Difficulty**: Test and adjust multipliers for game balance

### Integration Points

```typescript
// Initialize scoring system
const scoreCalculator = new ScoreCalculator(ScoreCalculator.getMemoryGameConfig());

// Calculate round score
const roundScore = scoreCalculator.calculateRoundScore(
  correctAnswers, mistakes, timeElapsed, roundNumber, currentStreak
);

// Get performance assessment
const performance = scoreCalculator.calculatePerformanceLevel(
  totalScore, totalRounds, totalTime, totalMistakes
);
```
